# LongMemEval Dataset Compliance Notes

## Overview
Created comprehensive dataset specification compliance tests to ensure both `sample_dataset_creator.py` and the benchmarker properly handle the LongMemEval dataset format.

## Key Findings

### 1. Integer Answers in Dataset
The official LongMemEval dataset specification states that answers should be strings, but the actual dataset contains 32 questions (6.4% of 500 total) with integer answers.

**Distribution by question type:**
- `multi-session`: 22 questions with integer answers
- `temporal-reasoning`: 8 questions with integer answers
- `knowledge-update`: 2 questions with integer answers

These are typically counting questions like:
- "How many items of clothing do I need to pick up?"
- "How many weeks ago did I meet up with my aunt?"
- "How many followers do I have on Instagram now?"

### 2. Compliance Test Implementation
The test suite (`tests/test_dataset_spec_compliance.py`) validates:
- All required fields are present
- Field types match specification
- Session structure is correct
- List lengths are consistent
- Answer session IDs are valid

### 3. Handling Spec Deviations
To handle the integer answers while maintaining awareness of the spec deviation:
1. Tests accept both strings and integers for answers
2. Warnings are issued for non-string answers
3. This allows the benchmarker to work with the actual dataset while documenting the deviation

## Test Coverage

The compliance test suite includes:
1. **Structure validation** - Ensures all required fields exist with correct types
2. **Sample dataset creator testing** - Validates output from the sampling tool
3. **Real dataset compliance** - Tests actual LongMemEval dataset files
4. **Benchmarker compatibility** - Ensures DatasetLoader handles spec-compliant data
5. **Session ordering validation** - Verifies chronological ordering for s/m versions

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation Update**: Either update the spec to allow integer answers or convert integers to strings in the dataset
2. **Benchmarker Robustness**: Ensure benchmarker handles both string and integer answers gracefully
3. **Type Coercion**: Consider adding automatic type conversion in the DatasetLoader if needed

## Test Results
All 6 compliance tests pass with 32 warnings about integer answers in the actual dataset.
